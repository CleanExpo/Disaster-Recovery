Client Frustrated → Contractor Blamed → Extended Timeline → Quality Issues → Client Turns Against Restorer
```

### Legal Foundation (Section 54, Insurance Contracts Act 1984)
**CRITICAL FINDING**: Policyholders have **legal right** to choose qualified contractors for emergency mitigation work. Insurance companies **cannot force** preferred contractors and **must pay** for reasonable emergency mitigation costs.
