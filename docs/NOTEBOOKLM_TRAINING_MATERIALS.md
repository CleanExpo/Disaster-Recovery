# MODULE 1: AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW & COMPLIANCE
## Day 1 Training Content

### CORE CONCEPT: Understanding Australian Consumer Law in Disaster Recovery

#### Introduction
The Australian Consumer Law (ACL) is a national law that protects consumers and ensures fair trading in Australia. As a disaster recovery contractor working with insurance claims, you must understand and comply with these laws to protect both your business and your clients.

#### Key Legislative Framework
- **Competition and Consumer Act 2010**: The primary legislation containing the ACL
- **Australian Consumer Law (Schedule 2)**: Specific consumer protections
- **State and Territory Fair Trading Acts**: Additional local requirements

### CONSUMER GUARANTEES (Sections 60-62)

#### Guarantee of Due Care and Skill (Section 60)
**What it means**: Services must be provided with due care and skill - the level of care and skill that a reasonable person would expect from a professional in your field.

**Practical Application in Disaster Recovery**:
- Water damage restoration must follow IICRC S500 standards
- Mould remediation must comply with IICRC S520 protocols
- All work must meet Australian Standards where applicable
- Documentation must be professional and accurate

**Example Scenario**: A contractor performs water damage restoration but fails to properly dry the subfloor. Six months later, mould develops. Under Section 60, the contractor has breached the guarantee of due care and skill because a competent professional would have ensured complete drying.

#### Guarantee of Fitness for Purpose (Section 61)
**What it means**: If a consumer tells you they want a service for a particular purpose, the service must be fit for that purpose.

**Practical Application**:
- If a client says they need mould removed for health reasons, your remediation must achieve safe air quality levels
- If insurance requires restoration to pre-loss condition, your work must achieve that standard
- Any limitations must be clearly communicated BEFORE work begins

**Example Scenario**: A client with severe asthma requires mould remediation. You must ensure your work meets health standards suitable for someone with respiratory conditions, not just general standards.

#### Guarantee of Reasonable Time (Section 62)
**What it means**: Services must be supplied within a reasonable time when no time is specified in the contract.

**What is "reasonable" in disaster recovery?**:
- Emergency make-safe: 4-24 hours
- Initial assessment: 24-48 hours
- Commencement of drying: 48-72 hours
- Factors affecting reasonableness: severity of damage, weather conditions, availability of equipment

### MISLEADING AND DECEPTIVE CONDUCT (Section 18)

#### The Golden Rule
You must not engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.

#### Common Violations in Our Industry:
1. **False Certification Claims**: Saying "IICRC Certified" when only one technician is certified
2. **Exaggerated Capabilities**: Claiming to handle asbestos without proper licensing
3. **Misleading Timeframes**: Promising unrealistic completion dates
4. **Hidden Costs**: Not disclosing all charges upfront

#### How to Stay Compliant:
- Be specific about certifications: "Our lead technician is IICRC certified"
- Clearly state any limitations or exclusions
- Provide realistic timeframes with contingencies
- Document all representations in writing

### UNFAIR CONTRACT TERMS (Sections 23-24)

#### What Makes a Term Unfair?
A term is unfair if it:
1. Causes significant imbalance between parties' rights
2. Is not reasonably necessary to protect legitimate interests
3. Would cause detriment if relied upon

#### Examples of Unfair Terms to Avoid:
- Unlimited right to vary prices without notice
- Blanket exclusion of all liability
- Automatic renewal without notification
- Excessive cancellation penalties
- One-sided termination rights

#### Creating Fair Contracts:
- Use plain English, avoid legal jargon
- Highlight important terms
- Allow reasonable cancellation rights
- Include dispute resolution procedures
- Ensure terms are balanced

### UNSOLICITED CONSUMER AGREEMENTS (Sections 69-88)

#### The 10-Day Cooling Off Rule
If you negotiate a contract at a place other than your business premises (door-to-door, at disaster site), the consumer has 10 business days to cancel without penalty.

#### Your Obligations:
1. **Disclosure Requirements**:
   - Provide written agreement immediately
   - Include cooling-off notice in prescribed form
   - State total price clearly
   - Cannot accept payment for 10 business days

2. **Prohibited Conduct**:
   - No visiting before 9am or after 6pm weekdays
   - No visiting before 9am or after 5pm Saturdays
   - No visiting on Sundays or public holidays
   - Must leave immediately if asked

#### Best Practice Approach:
- Have clients come to your office when possible
- If on-site agreement necessary, ensure full compliance
- Use technology for remote agreements (email/online)
- Keep detailed records of how agreement was formed

### DEALING WITH VULNERABLE CONSUMERS

#### Identifying Vulnerable Consumers:
- Elderly persons living alone
- People with obvious cognitive impairment
- Non-English speakers
- People in severe distress post-disaster
- Those with mental health conditions

#### Your Ethical and Legal Obligations:
1. Ensure genuine informed consent
2. Suggest involvement of support person
3. Provide information in accessible formats
4. Allow extra time for decisions
5. Document capacity concerns

#### Red Flags Requiring Extra Care:
- Consumer doesn't understand scope or price
- Family members object to agreement
- Consumer seems confused or pressured
- Unusual payment arrangements requested
- Consumer has no insurance or funds

### PENALTIES AND CONSEQUENCES

#### Civil Penalties for ACL Breaches:
- Individuals: Up to $500,000 per breach
- Corporations: Up to $10 million, 3x benefit gained, or 10% annual turnover

#### Additional Consequences:
- Injunctions stopping you from trading
- Compensation orders to affected consumers
- Public warning notices
- Corrective advertising orders
- Disqualification from managing companies

# MODULE 2: INSURANCE CONTRACTS ACT & SECTION 54
## Day 2 Training Content

### UNDERSTANDING THE INSURANCE CONTRACTS ACT 1984

#### Purpose and Scope
The Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (ICA) regulates insurance contracts in Australia and provides critical protections for both insureds and contractors working on insurance claims.

### SECTION 54: THE CONTRACTOR'S SHIELD

#### What Section 54 Says
"An insurer cannot refuse a claim based on an act or omission that could not reasonably be regarded as capable of causing or contributing to the loss."

#### Why This Matters for Contractors
Section 54 protects you when:
- Minor procedural breaches occur
- Documentation isn't perfect
- Timelines slip slightly
- Communication gaps happen

#### The Key Test: Causation
The insurer must prove the breach:
1. Actually caused or contributed to the loss, OR
2. Prejudiced their interests

#### Practical Examples:

**Scenario 1 - Protected by Section 54**:
A contractor forgets to submit daily moisture readings for 3 days during a 2-week drying project. The insurer cannot deny the claim because the missing documentation didn't cause the water damage or materially prejudice their position.

**Scenario 2 - NOT Protected**:
A contractor starts CAT-3 water remediation without proper containment, causing mould to spread throughout the property. This breach directly contributed to additional damage and is not protected.

### INSURANCE AUTHORISATIONS AND LIMITS

#### Understanding Make-Safe Authorisations
**Typical Limits**:
- Emergency make-safe: $3,000-$5,000
- Initial mitigation: $10,000-$15,000
- Full restoration: Requires detailed scope approval

#### Critical Rules:
1. **Never Exceed Without Written Approval**
   - Verbal approvals are worthless
   - Email confirmation minimum
   - Reference claim number always

2. **Document Everything**
   - Photos before starting
   - Time-stamped progress shots
   - Moisture readings with location
   - Equipment placement records

#### What Happens When You Exceed Authority?

**You Exceed by $2,000 Without Approval**:
- Insurer may only pay authorized amount
- You bear the excess cost
- Potential relationship damage
- Possible panel removal

**Best Practice Protocol**:
1. Stop at 75% of authorization
2. Document need for additional work
3. Submit variation request with photos
4. Wait for written approval
5. Continue only after confirmation

### CASH SETTLEMENTS AND UNDERINSURANCE

#### The 80% Co-Insurance Rule
Most policies require coverage of at least 80% of replacement value. If underinsured, claims are reduced proportionally.

#### Calculation Formula:
```
Settlement = (Sum Insured / (Replacement Value × 0.8)) × Loss Amount
```

#### Real-World Example:
- **Building Replacement Value**: $600,000
- **Sum Insured**: $400,000
- **Storm Damage Claim**: $80,000
- **Required Insurance (80%)**: $480,000
- **Actual Settlement**: $400,000/$480,000 × $80,000 = $66,667
- **Shortfall Client Pays**: $13,333

#### Your Role as Contractor:
- Identify potential underinsurance early
- Document and communicate to all parties
- Adjust scope to available funds if needed
- Never mislead about coverage gaps

### MANAGING INSURANCE DISPUTES

#### Common Dispute Triggers:
1. **Scope Creep**: Work beyond original damage
2. **Betterment**: Upgrades not covered
3. **Pre-existing Damage**: Not related to claim event
4. **Causation Arguments**: Multiple potential causes
5. **Policy Exclusions**: Mould, asbestos, wear and tear

#### The S.A.F.E. Method for Dispute Resolution:
- **S**top: Don't continue disputed work
- **A**ssess: Document the issue thoroughly
- **F**acilitate: Arrange meeting with all parties
- **E**scalate: Use proper channels if unresolved

### GENERAL INSURANCE CODE OF PRACTICE

#### Key Requirements Affecting Contractors:
1. **Claims Handling Timeframes**:
   - Initial contact: 1 business day
   - Urgent assessment: 24 hours
   - Routine assessment: 5 business days
   - Decision on claim: 10 business days

2. **Communication Standards**:
   - Plain English required
   - Interpreter services for ESL clients
   - Vulnerable person identification
   - Regular progress updates

#### Your Compliance Obligations:
- Respond to insurer requests promptly
- Maintain professional communication
- Report significant discoveries immediately
- Preserve evidence of damage

# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQs)

## Legal & Compliance FAQs

**Q: What happens if I accidentally mislead a customer about my certifications?**
A: Immediately correct the misrepresentation in writing. Under ACL Section 18, unintentional misleading conduct is still a violation. Document the correction, apologize, and ensure all future representations are accurate. If work was performed, you may need to offer remediation or refund.

**Q: Can I charge a call-out fee for a quote on insurance work?**
A: Yes, but it must be disclosed upfront before you attend. Many insurers won't reimburse call-out fees for quotes, so charging the customer may affect your competitiveness. Best practice: absorb this cost as marketing expense.

**Q: A client wants to cancel after 11 business days. Do I have to refund?**
A: If it's an unsolicited consumer agreement (signed at their property), the cooling-off period is 10 business days. After day 10, standard contract terms apply. However, consider the relationship and potential ACL consumer guarantee issues before refusing.

**Q: What if an elderly client with dementia wants to sign a $50,000 contract?**
A: Do not proceed without a legally authorized representative. Suggest involving family, their lawyer, or seeking a guardianship order. A contract with someone lacking capacity is void and exposes you to serious liability.

## Insurance Process FAQs

**Q: The insurer authorized $5,000 but the job needs $7,000. What do I do?**
A: Stop work at $4,000 (80% of authorization). Document why additional funds are needed with photos and detailed scope. Submit variation request in writing. Only proceed after written approval. If denied, give client options to self-fund or reduce scope.

**Q: Can I start emergency work without insurance approval?**
A: Yes, for genuine emergencies threatening safety or property. Document extensively: time-stamped photos, safety hazards, potential for increased damage. Most policies allow emergency mitigation. Keep work to minimum necessary and seek approval ASAP.

**Q: The adjuster says mould isn't covered. Should I tell the client?**
A: Yes, immediately and in writing. Explain the coverage decision, their options (pay privately, dispute with insurer, reduce scope), and get written instructions before proceeding. Never hide coverage issues - this violates your duty of care.

**Q: How do I handle betterment charges?**
A: Document the exact pre-loss condition. When upgrades are necessary (code requirements, availability), clearly identify betterment amounts. Get written approval from client for their portion before proceeding. Invoice separately for transparency.

## Technical/Operational FAQs

**Q: How long can I run air movers before checking moisture levels?**
A: Initial check within 24 hours, then daily. Running equipment without monitoring wastes money and risks secondary damage (over-drying, excessive heat). Daily monitoring is IICRC S500 standard and insurance requirement.

**Q: When does Category 1 water become Category 2?**
A: After 48 hours in normal conditions. Factors accelerating deterioration: high temperature (>75°F), pre-existing contamination, organic materials present. Document category changes immediately as this affects scope and pricing.

**Q: Can I use bleach for mould remediation?**
A: No. Bleach doesn't penetrate porous materials and leaves moisture behind. Use EPA-registered antimicrobials designed for mould. IICRC S520 specifies appropriate products. Bleach can also damage materials and create harmful fumes.

**Q: What moisture content is "dry" for hardwood floors?**
A: Match unaffected areas, typically 6-9% depending on species and climate. National Wood Flooring Association standards apply. Document baseline readings from unaffected areas. Consider seasonal variations and HVAC operation.

## Business Operations FAQs

**Q: How long must I keep job documentation?**
A: Seven years minimum for tax/legal purposes. For insurance work, keep indefinitely as claims can reopen. Digital storage is acceptable. Include contracts, photos, moisture logs, invoices, correspondence, and certificates of completion.

**Q: Can I subcontract specialized work like asbestos?**
A: Yes, but only to properly licensed contractors. You remain liable for subcontractor work. Verify licenses, insurance, and competence. Include indemnity clauses in subcontract agreements. Inform client and insurer of subcontracting.

**Q: Should I guarantee my work beyond consumer law requirements?**
A: Offering warranties can differentiate your service, but ensure terms are clear and financially viable. Consider warranty insurance. Never guarantee against acts of God, maintenance issues, or manufacturer defects. Put all warranties in writing.

**Q: How do I handle customer complaints on social media?**
A: Respond professionally and promptly: acknowledge concern, don't argue publicly, move detailed discussion offline, never breach client confidentiality. Have a social media policy. Consider professional reputation management services.

## Payment & Financial FAQs

**Q: When can I require upfront payment?**
A: For insurance work, generally after insurer approval. For private work, reasonable deposits (10-30%) are acceptable. For materials, can require payment before ordering. Must comply with any cooling-off periods. Document all payments clearly.

**Q: What if insurance pays less than my invoice?**
A: Review adjustment reasons. If legitimate (documentation issues, scope questions), correct and resubmit. If disputed, use insurer's dispute process. Client generally not liable for insurer's adjustments unless work was unauthorized.

**Q: Can I charge storage fees for customer contents?**
A: Yes, if agreed in writing beforehand. Include in initial contract: daily/weekly rate, liability limitations, disposal rights for abandoned items. Most insurers cover reasonable storage fees during restoration.
