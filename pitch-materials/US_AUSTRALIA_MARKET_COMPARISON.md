## CONCLUSION

The evidence clearly shows Australia's restoration industry is following the exact same evolutionary path as the US market, but with a 10-15 year delay. This creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity for NRP to introduce a proven platform model before the market consolidates around legacy players. The current crisis in the Australian construction/restoration sector (3,200+ failures) combined with regulatory pressure creates the perfect conditions for disruption - exactly as occurred in the US market circa 2010.
