# US RESTORATION COMPANIES & AUSTRALIAN MARKET OPPORTUNITY
## Evidence of Entry Attempts and Acquisition Targets

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Critical Finding**: No major US restoration franchise (SERVPRO, Paul Davis, BELFOR) currently operates in Australia, despite their aggressive North American expansion.

## ACTION ITEMS FOR NRP

### Positioning for US Partnership/Acquisition

   - Lock in contractor relationships
   - Establish insurance partnerships

2. **Create Acquisition Triggers**
   - Reach $10M ARR (attractive size)
   - Prove platform scalability
   - Document 85%+ gross margins

3. **Engage Early**
   - Attend US restoration conferences
   - Build relationships with PE firms
   - Position as "Australian Restoration Platform"

## KEY TAKEAWAY

**The Window Is Now**: US restoration companies are running out of North American growth opportunities. With 2,300+ SERVPRO locations and 300+ Paul Davis franchises saturating the US/Canada market, international expansion is inevitable. Australia represents the most logical next market, and NRP can position itself as either the defensive Australian champion or the perfect acquisition vehicle for US entry.

**Critical Timing**: Johns Lyng's US acquisitions show Australian companies understand this dynamic. NRP must move quickly to establish platform dominance before US companies enter directly or acquire Johns Lyng as their entry vehicle.
