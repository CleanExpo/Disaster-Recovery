# Fixing Playwright MCP Setup

## Option 1: Use Existing Puppeteer MCP (Recommended)
Since you already have Puppeteer MCP configured in Cline, you can use it for browser automation tasks. Puppeteer provides similar capabilities to Playwright.

## Option 2: Add Playwright MCP to Cline Configuration
If you specifically need Playwright MCP, add it to your `cline_mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "puppeteer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "puppeteer-mcp-server"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-playwright"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "context7": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["D:\\Disaster Recovery\\context7\\dist\\index.js"],
      "env": {"NODE_ENV": "production"}
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["D:\\Disaster Recovery\\WSL-Deployment-Sequential-Thinking\\dist\\cli.js"],
      "env": {"NODE_ENV": "production"}
    }
  }
}
```

## Option 3: Use Official MCP Playwright Server
The official MCP Playwright server is `@modelcontextprotocol/server-playwright`. To use it:

1. Install the official server:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-playwright
   ```

2. Update your configuration to use the official package

## Option 4: Use Playwright Directly in Code
Since you have Playwright installed, you can use it directly in your scripts without MCP:

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  // Your automation code here
  await browser.close();
})();
```

## Current Working Alternative
You already have Puppeteer MCP configured in Cline, which provides browser automation. Use it with:
- Launch browser
- Navigate to pages
- Take screenshots
- Interact with elements
- Execute JavaScript

## Testing MCP Servers
To test if an MCP server is working:

1. Check if it's listed in your Cline configuration
2. Try using it through Cline's browser_action tool (for Puppeteer)
3. Check the Cline MCP status indicator in VS Code

## Troubleshooting
- The `@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server` package seems to have issues
- Consider using the official `@modelcontextprotocol/server-playwright` instead
- Ensure your VS Code and Cline extension are up to date
