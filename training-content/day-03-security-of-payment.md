**NARRATOR:** In 2023, Australian contractors were owed $8.1 billion in unpaid invoices. Today, we'll show you how Security of Payment legislation guarantees your right to be paid.

**[GRAPHIC: Map of Australia showing different SOP Acts]**

- **NSW:** Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999
- **QLD:** Building Industry Fairness (Security of Payment) Act 2017

## Part 1: Understanding Your Rights (5:00-20:00)

### The Fundamental Principle

**[ANIMATED DIAGRAM: Money flow from customer to contractor]**

**LEGAL EXPERT:** "Security of Payment creates a statutory right to progress payments. You cannot contract out of it. Even if your contract says no progress payments, the Act overrides it."

### Key Rights Under All Acts

**[CHECKLIST GRAPHIC]**

✅ **Right to Progress Payments**
- Even if contract is silent
- Even if work not complete
- Even for variations

✅ **Right to Suspend Work**
- For non-payment
- After proper notice
- Without breach

✅ **Right to Adjudication**
- Fast-track dispute resolution
- 10-20 business days typically
- Binding determination

✅ **Right to Interest**
- On late payments
- Higher penalty rates
- Compound interest possible

### State-Specific Differences

**[COMPARISON TABLE]**

| Element | NSW | QLD | VIC | WA |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Reference Date | End of month | End of month | Claim date | Contract/monthly |
| Time to Claim | 12 months | 6 months | 3 months | 28 days |
| Payment Terms | 10 bus days | 15/25 bus days | 10 bus days | 42 days |
| Adjudication Time | 5 bus days | 10/15 bus days | 10 bus days | 14 days |

## Part 2: NSW Security of Payment (20:00-35:00)

3. Cost breakdown provided
4. Notice requirements met
5. Approval documented

**EXAMPLE CALCULATION:**
```
Original: Remove carpet only

# PODCAST EPISODE: "Get Paid or Stop Work" (30 minutes)

## Introduction (0:00-2:00)

**HOST 1 (Sarah):** Welcome to the Restoration Business Podcast. I'm Sarah Mitchell.

**HOST 2 (Dave):** And I'm Dave Thompson. Sarah, today we're talking about every contractor's favorite topic - getting paid.

**SARAH:** And more importantly, what to do when you don't get paid. The Security of Payment Act gives you powerful rights most contractors don't even know about.

## The Payment Problem (2:00-8:00)

**DAVE:** Let's start with the reality. Industry surveys show the average contractor waits 62 days for payment. Some wait 90, 120 days or never get paid at all.

**SARAH:** But here's what kills me, Dave. Most don't know they can force payment in 20 days using Security of Payment.

**DAVE:** Tell us about a real case.

**SARAH:** Melbourne contractor, let's call him Tony. Did $120,000 of flood restoration. Insurance company dragging their feet, builder above him playing games. Month three, still no payment.

**DAVE:** Cash flow crisis?

**SARAH:** Couldn't pay his suppliers. Nearly lost his house. Then his lawyer introduced him to Security of Payment. Within 20 days, full payment plus interest.

**DAVE:** How?

**SARAH:** Payment claim served. No payment schedule provided. Adjudication application. Deemed acceptance. Game over.

## Understanding Payment Claims (8:00-15:00)

**DAVE:** Break down a payment claim for us.

**SARAH:** It's not an invoice. Critical distinction. An invoice is a request. A payment claim is a statutory demand with legal consequences.

**DAVE:** What makes it different?

**SARAH:** Four things. First, it must say "This is a payment claim under the Security of Payment Act." Second, identify the exact work. Third, state the amount. Fourth, be served properly.

**DAVE:** What happens when you serve one?

**SARAH:** Clock starts ticking. Respondent has 10 business days in most states to either pay or provide a payment schedule saying why they won't pay.

**DAVE:** What if they ignore it?

**SARAH:** That's the beautiful part. Silence equals acceptance. They've agreed to pay the full amount. You can either sue for debt or go to adjudication.

**DAVE:** Which is better?

**SARAH:** Adjudication. Faster, cheaper, and they can't bring up new defenses later.

## Common Mistakes (15:00-22:00)

**DAVE:** What mistakes do contractors make?

**SARAH:** Biggest one? Not calling it a payment claim. They send a beautiful invoice with all the details but forget the magic words. No statutory rights.

**DAVE:** What else?

**SARAH:** Claiming before the reference date. If your reference date is end of month, you can't claim on the 28th. Invalid claim, start again.

**DAVE:** I've seen contractors claim the same period twice.

**SARAH:** Death sentence for a claim. Each period can only be claimed once. Even if you forgot something, too bad. Wait for next month.

**DAVE:** What about insufficient detail?

**SARAH:** Another killer. "Restoration work - $50,000" won't cut it. Break it down. dates, locations, specific work. Give them no wiggle room.

## The Nuclear Option (22:00-27:00)

**DAVE:** Let's talk about suspension of work.

**SARAH:** The nuclear option. If they don't pay according to adjudication or after proper notice, you can legally down tools.

**DAVE:** Without breaching contract?

**SARAH:** Correct. It's a statutory right. Give proper notice, usually 2-3 business days, then stop. They can't terminate you for it.

**DAVE:** Have you seen it used?

**SARAH:** Contractor in Brisbane. Major commercial flood job. Adjudication awarded $200,000. Client didn't pay. Contractor suspended work. Client tried to terminate. Court said no, pay up or work stays suspended.

**DAVE:** What happened?

**SARAH:** Paid within 24 hours. Amazing how quick they find money when the site's shut down.

## Practical Tips (27:00-30:00)

**SARAH:** Three tips for our listeners. First, create a payment claim template today. Don't wait until you need it.

**DAVE:** Second?

**SARAH:** Set up a system. Reference date in your calendar. Payment claim ready day one. Track response deadlines. Be mechanical about it.

**DAVE:** Third?

**SARAH:** Don't be afraid to use it. This isn't aggressive, it's professional. The Act exists because payment problems destroy businesses.

**DAVE:** Final thoughts?

**SARAH:** The Security of Payment Act is your shield and sword. Learn it, use it, get paid. Your family's financial security depends on it.

**DAVE:** Thanks for listening. Next week, we're discussing how to price emergency call-outs for maximum profit.

**SARAH:** Until then, serve those payment claims and get paid!
