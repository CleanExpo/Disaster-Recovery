## Opening: The $147,000 GST Mistake (0:00-5:00)

**[OPENING SHOT: ATO enforcement notice on screen]**

**NARRATOR:** In 2023, a Sydney restoration contractor thought GST was simple - just add 10%. His mistake cost him $147,000 in penalties, interest, and back payments. Today, we ensure this never happens to you.

**[GRAPHIC: GST Impact on Cash Flow]**
- Collect GST: You're holding government money
- Pay GST: Quarterly or monthly
- Get it wrong: Penalties, interest, audits
- Get it right: Smooth cash flow, compliance

## Part 1: Understanding GST Fundamentals (5:00-20:00)

### What is GST?

**[ANIMATED EXPLANATION]**

**GST (Goods and Services Tax):**
- 10% tax on most goods and services
- You collect for the government
- You're liable even if customer doesn't pay
- Applies to all business supplies

### The GST Formula

**[CALCULATION GRAPHICS]**

**GST INCLUSIVE PRICING:**
```
Base Price: $10,000
GST (10%): $1,000
Total Invoice: $11,000
```

**EXTRACTING GST FROM TOTAL:**
```
Total Amount: $11,000
GST Component: $11,000 ÷ 11 = $1,000
Base Amount: $10,000
```

**COMMON MISTAKE:**
```
WRONG: $11,000 × 10% = $1,100 (Incorrect!)
RIGHT: $11,000 ÷ 11 = $1,000 (Correct!)
```

### GST Registration Requirements

**[THRESHOLD DIAGRAM]**

# PODCAST EPISODE: "The GST Trap" (30 minutes)

## Introduction (0:00-2:00)

**HOST 1 (Mark):** Welcome to the Restoration Business Podcast. I'm Mark Williams.

**HOST 2 (Jennifer):** And I'm Jennifer Chen. Mark, today we're talking about everyone's favorite topic - GST.

**MARK:** [Laughs] Favorite might be stretching it, Jen. But it's definitely the most important. Get GST wrong and the ATO will destroy you.

## The Basics People Get Wrong (2:00-10:00)

**JENNIFER:** Let's start with the biggest misconception about GST.

**MARK:** That it's your money. I see contractors all the time treating GST like profit. They collect $10,000 in GST, spend it on equipment, then can't pay their BAS.

**JENNIFER:** It's the government's money, you're just holding it.

**MARK:** Exactly. Here's my rule - GST collected goes into a separate account immediately. Don't touch it. It's not yours.

**JENNIFER:** Smart. What's the next big mistake?

**MARK:** The inclusive/exclusive confusion. Customer pays you $11,000. How much GST is in that?

**JENNIFER:** $1,000. You divide by 11, not multiply by 10%.

**MARK:** Right! But I see contractors calculating $11,000 × 10% = $1,100. They overpay GST by $100. Do that on every job, it adds up.

**JENNIFER:** What about claiming GST on purchases?

**MARK:** Another minefield. You can only claim if you have a valid tax invoice. Not a receipt, not a handwritten note - a proper tax invoice with ABN, "tax invoice" stated, all the requirements.

## Insurance Work Complications (10:00-18:00)

**JENNIFER:** Insurance work has its own GST quirks, doesn't it?

**MARK:** Oh boy, does it. Here's a scenario - you do $50,000 of restoration. Insurance pays $45,000, customer supposedly pays $5,000 excess but never does. What's your GST position?

**JENNIFER:** You've paid GST on the full $50,000?

**MARK:** Correct. $5,000 to the ATO based on a $50,000 sale. But you only collected $45,000. If the customer doesn't pay, you can claim a decreasing adjustment - get back the $500 GST on the unpaid portion.

**JENNIFER:** But you need to document the bad debt properly.

**MARK:** Absolutely. Write-off procedures, attempts to collect, formal bad debt declaration. Otherwise, ATO says you're still liable.

**JENNIFER:** What about cash jobs?

**MARK:** There are no cash jobs if you're GST registered. If you're registered and doing business, GST applies. End of story. I don't care if the customer pays cash, card, or chickens - you owe GST.

## The BAS Nightmare (18:00-25:00)

**JENNIFER:** Talk about BAS preparation. Where do contractors go wrong?

**MARK:** They leave it to the last minute. Night before it's due, scrambling for receipts, trying to remember transactions. Recipe for disaster.

**JENNIFER:** What's your system?

**MARK:** Weekly routine. Every Friday, 30 minutes. Enter the week's invoices and bills into my spreadsheet. Check they match the bank. File the paperwork. Come BAS time, it's just pressing calculate.

**JENNIFER:** What about the contractors who say they're too busy?

**MARK:** Too busy to avoid $10,000 in penalties? Too busy to stay out of jail? The ATO doesn't care that you were busy. They care that you comply.

**JENNIFER:** Harsh but true. What about getting help?

**MARK:** Best money you'll spend. A good BAS agent costs maybe $300 per quarter. The penalties for one mistake can be $3,000. It's not even a question.

## Closing Advice (25:00-30:00)

**JENNIFER:** Three pieces of advice for our listeners on GST?

**MARK:** One - separate bank account for GST. Two - proper tax invoices always, no exceptions. Three - weekly bookkeeping, not quarterly panic.

**JENNIFER:** What about contractors just starting out?

**MARK:** Register for GST voluntarily even under $75,000. You can claim GST on all your startup costs, equipment, vehicles. Plus you look professional. Just remember - once you're in, you're in for at least 12 months.

**JENNIFER:** Final thoughts?

**MARK:** GST isn't complicated if you have systems. It's devastating if you don't. Choose wisely.

**JENNIFER:** Thanks for listening. Next week - how to handle insurance claim disputes like a pro.

**MARK:** Until then, keep those tax invoices valid!

# INTERACTIVE QUIZ: Day 4 Assessment

A) Company name and total amount
B) "Tax Invoice", ABN, date, description, GST shown separately
C) Just an invoice number and amount
D) Email confirmation is enough

**Answer:** B

A) When you pay the bill
B) When you receive the bill
C) When you hold a valid tax invoice

A) $3,000
B) $13,000
C) $5,000

**Answer:** A
**Explanation:** GST owing = GST collected - GST paid = $8,000 - $5,000 = $3,000

Customer pays $10,000 but not their $1,000 excess. Your GST position?

A) Pay GST on $10,000 only
B) Pay GST on $11,000, claim adjustment later

**Explanation:** GST records must be kept for 5 years from when the record was prepared, obtained, or the transaction completed, whichever is later.

Penalty for not registering when required?

A) Warning only
B) Up to $4,440 plus GST owed
C) $1,000 fixed
D) No penalty if you register late

**Answer:** B

## Question 10

B) Always cash
C) Cash for most contractors
