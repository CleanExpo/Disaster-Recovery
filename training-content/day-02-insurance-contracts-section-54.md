# VIDEO SCRIPT 1: Section 54 - Your Shield Against Unfair Claim Denials (120 minutes)

## Opening: The Game-Changing Case (0:00-5:00)

**[OPENING SHOT: Courtroom exterior, then newspaper headline]**

**NARRATOR:** In 2019, a Queensland restoration contractor faced bankruptcy. The insurer denied a $380,000 claim because the contractor submitted daily reports 3 days late. One section of law saved his business - Section 54 of the Insurance Contracts Act.

**[GRAPHIC: Section 54 text highlighted]**

"An insurer may not refuse a claim by reason of an act or omission that could not reasonably be regarded as capable of causing or contributing to the loss."

**[INTERVIEW FOOTAGE: Contractor]**

**CONTRACTOR:** "I thought we were finished. Three days late with paperwork, and they wanted to deny the entire claim. My lawyer mentioned Section 54, and everything changed."

## Part 1: Understanding Section 54 (5:00-25:00)

### The Foundation Principle

**[ANIMATED DIAGRAM: Shield protecting contractor from claim denial]**

**LEGAL EXPERT (Professor James Mitchell):** Section 54 is revolutionary. It shifts focus from procedural perfection to actual causation. The question isn't "Did you breach a condition?" but "Did that breach cause the loss?"

### The Three-Part Test

**[FLOWCHART ANIMATION]**

1. **Was there an act or omission?**
   - Late notification
   - Missing documentation
   - Procedural breach
   - Non-compliance with condition

2. **Did it cause or contribute to the loss?**
   - Would damage have occurred anyway?
   - Did breach worsen the damage?
   - Was insurer prejudiced?

3. **If no causation, claim cannot be denied**
   - Insurer may reduce for prejudice
   - But cannot deny entirely

### Real-World Applications

**[CASE STUDY 1: The Holiday Notification]**

**Scenario:** Water pipe bursts December 23rd. Policy requires notification within 48 hours. Contractor notifies December 28th after Christmas break.

**Insurer's Position:** "Breach of notification clause - claim denied."

**Section 54 Analysis:**
- Late notification didn't cause water damage
- 5-day delay didn't worsen damage
- Insurer not materially prejudiced
- **Result:** Claim must be paid

**[CASE STUDY 2: The Containment Failure]**

**Scenario:** Category 3 water job. Contractor doesn't properly contain, spreads contamination to clean areas.

**Insurer's Position:** "Breach of professional standards - claim denied."

**Section 54 Analysis:**
- Breach directly caused additional damage
- Contamination wouldn't have spread with proper containment
- Insurer significantly prejudiced
- **Result:** Denial likely upheld

### When Section 54 Protects You

**[PROTECTION CHECKLIST]**

✅ **Late reports that don't affect damage**
- Daily moisture logs submitted weekly
- Progress photos delayed
- Completion certificates late

✅ **Minor procedural breaches**
- Wrong form used
- Missing signature
- Incorrect reference number

✅ **Technical non-compliance**
- Report in wrong format
- Submitted to wrong department
- Missing appendix

✅ **Reasonable mistakes**
- Misunderstood deadline
- Communication breakdown
- System failures

### When Section 54 Won't Help

**[WARNING SIGNS]**

❌ **Breaches causing damage**
- Improper drying causing mould
- Delayed response worsening damage
- Wrong category treatment

❌ **Fraudulent conduct**
- False claims
- Inflated invoices
- Fictitious damage

❌ **Intentional non-compliance**
- Deliberately ignoring procedures
- Refusing to provide documents
- Willful policy breaches

## Part 2: Practical Application (25:00-45:00)

### Documentation Strategies

**[SCREEN RECORDING: Documentation system]**

**BEST PRACTICE FRAMEWORK:**

1. **Time-stamp everything**
   ```
   Photo: IMG_2024_03_15_14:30:00_bedroom_moisture.jpg
   Log: "15/03/2024 2:30 PM - Moisture reading bedroom wall: 18%"
   ```

2. **Create redundancy**
   - Email reports
   - Upload to portal
   - SMS confirmation
   - Keep local copies

3. **Acknowledge delays**
   ```
   "Due to severe weather preventing site access, 
   daily reports for March 15-17 submitted together 
   on March 18. No change to damage status during 
   this period."
   ```

### Communication Protocols

**[ROLE-PLAY: Phone conversation with insurer]**

**CONTRACTOR:** "I need to vary from the scope due to hidden damage."

**INSURER:** "You should have known about it."

**CONTRACTOR:** "The damage was behind fixed cabinetry. I'm notifying you immediately upon discovery. Section 54 protects reasonable omissions that don't cause loss."

**INSURER:** "Submit documentation and we'll review."

**CONTRACTOR:** "Sending photos and revised scope now. Please confirm receipt."

### The Prejudice Reduction

**[CALCULATION EXAMPLE]**

Even when protected by Section 54, insurers can reduce payments for prejudice:

**Scenario:** Late notification costs insurer opportunity for cheaper emergency response

- **Claim amount:** $50,000
- **Insurer's increased cost:** $5,000
- **Reduction for prejudice:** $5,000
- **Payment to contractor:** $45,000

**KEY POINT:** Reduction must be proportionate to actual prejudice, not punitive.

## Part 3: Managing Insurance Authorizations (45:00-65:00)

### Authorization Limits Framework

**[GRAPHIC: Authorization pyramid]**

**TIER 1: Make-Safe ($3,000-5,000)**
- Immediate danger mitigation
- Tarping, water extraction
- Power isolation
- Usually automatic

**TIER 2: Mitigation ($10,000-15,000)**
- Prevent further damage
- Drying equipment
- Initial demolition
- Often pre-approved

**TIER 3: Restoration (Varies)**
- Full scope approval needed
- Detailed quote required
- Multiple approvals possible
- Always get writing

### The 75% Rule

**[DASHBOARD VISUALIZATION]**

**Never exceed authorization. Stop at 75% and reassess:**

```
Authorization: $10,000
75% trigger: $7,500
Current spend: $7,485

ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Stop work
2. Document status
3. Calculate remaining needs
4. Submit variation request
5. Await approval
```

### Variation Request Template

**[DOCUMENT TEMPLATE]**

```
URGENT: Variation Request - Claim #123456

Current Authorization: $10,000
Work Completed: $7,500 (75%)
Additional Required: $5,000
New Total: $15,000

JUSTIFICATION:
- Hidden damage discovered [photos attached]
- Additional contamination found [test results attached]
- Structural issue identified [engineer report attached]

CONSEQUENCES OF NOT PROCEEDING:
- Secondary damage likely
- Mould growth risk
- Structural compromise

Approval requested by: [Date/Time]
```

### Managing Denied Variations

**[DECISION TREE]**

```
Variation Denied
    ↓
Document denial reason
    ↓
Assess options:
├── Critical safety issue?
│   └── Complete and document emergency
├── Customer willing to pay?
│   └── Get written authorization
└── Can reduce scope?
    └── Revise to fit authorization
```

## Part 4: Cash Settlements and Co-Insurance (65:00-85:00)

### Understanding Under-Insurance

**[ANIMATED EXPLANATION]**

Most policies contain co-insurance clauses requiring coverage of at least 80% of replacement value.

**The Formula:**
```
Settlement = (Sum Insured ÷ (Replacement Value × 0.8)) × Loss Amount
```

### Calculation Workshop

**[INTERACTIVE CALCULATOR]**

**EXAMPLE 1: Residential Property**
- Replacement value: $500,000
- Sum insured: $400,000
- Storm damage: $50,000
- Required insurance (80%): $400,000
- Calculation: $400,000/$400,000 × $50,000
- **Settlement: $50,000 (full amount)**

**EXAMPLE 2: Under-Insured Commercial**
- Replacement value: $1,000,000
- Sum insured: $600,000
- Fire damage: $200,000
- Required insurance (80%): $800,000
- Calculation: $600,000/$800,000 × $200,000
- **Settlement: $150,000 (reduced)**
- **Shortfall: $50,000**

### Managing Under-Insurance Situations

**[BEST PRACTICE GUIDE]**

1. **Early Identification**
   - Review policy limits immediately
   - Calculate potential shortfall
   - Document and notify all parties

2. **Communication Strategy**
   ```
   "Mr. Smith, I've reviewed your policy. Based on current 
   replacement costs, there may be a shortfall. Let's discuss 
   options before proceeding."
   ```

3. **Options for Customers**
   - Reduce scope to essential repairs
   - Self-fund the gap
   - Payment plans
   - Challenge insurer's calculation

4. **Protect Yourself**
   - Get written acknowledgment of shortfall
   - Clear scope within available funds
   - Don't promise what insurance won't cover
   - Document customer decisions

## Part 5: Common Insurance Disputes (85:00-105:00)

### Dispute Category 1: Scope of Works

**[CASE ANALYSIS]**

**THE DISPUTE:**
Insurer: "Replace damaged sections only"
Contractor: "Must replace entire floor for matching"

**RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK:**
1. Document impossibility of matching
2. Get manufacturer statement
3. Reference Australian Standards
4. Cite reasonableness requirement
5. Escalate through proper channels

### Dispute Category 2: Betterment

**[VISUAL COMPARISON]**

**What is Betterment?**
- Upgrade from original specification
- Improvement beyond pre-loss condition
- Enhanced materials or finishes
- Code-required upgrades

**HANDLING BETTERMENT:**
```
Original: Single-glazed windows
Damaged in: Hailstorm
Available: Only double-glazed now
Betterment: $2,000 difference
Customer pays: Difference only
```

### Dispute Category 3: Causation

**[INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGY]**

**MULTIPLE CAUSES SCENARIO:**
- Storm damage (covered)
- Existing roof issues (not covered)
- Poor maintenance (not covered)
- Age deterioration (not covered)

**APPROACH:**
1. Separate covered from non-covered
2. Document with expert opinions
3. Allocate percentages
4. Clear scope division
5. Customer agreement on gaps

### Dispute Category 4: Pre-Existing Damage

**[EVIDENCE COLLECTION]**

**PROVING NEW vs OLD:**
- Google Street View history
- Previous inspection reports
- Date stamps on materials
- Weathering patterns
- Neighbor testimony
- Historical weather data

### The S.T.A.I.R. Dispute Process

**[PROCESS DIAGRAM]**

**S** - Stop and assess
**T** - Talk to all parties
**A** - Analyze documentation
**I** - Identify resolution options
**R** - Record everything

## Part 6: Advanced Strategies (105:00-120:00)

### Using Section 54 Proactively

**[STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK]**

1. **In Initial Communications**
   ```
   "We operate under Section 54 protections, focusing on 
   damage prevention rather than procedural perfection."
   ```

2. **In Variation Requests**
   ```
   "While this varies from original scope, Section 54 
   protects reasonable variations that prevent further loss."
   ```

3. **In Dispute Resolution**
   ```
   "The delay in documentation didn't cause or contribute 
   to the loss, therefore Section 54 applies."
   ```

### Building Insurer Relationships

**[RELATIONSHIP MATRIX]**

**HIGH VALUE ACTIONS:**
- Consistent quality work
- Predictable documentation
- Proactive communication
- Problem-solving approach
- Cost-conscious decisions

**REPUTATION BUILDERS:**
- Never inflate claims

## Part 3: When Authorization is Denied (35:00-50:00)

### The Decision Framework

**[FLOWCHART]**

```
Authorization Denied
        ↓
Is it a safety issue?
    ├─ Yes → Document and complete
    │        (Section 54 protection)
    └─ No → Proceed to options
            ↓
        Customer Options:
        ├─ Pay privately
        ├─ Reduce scope
        ├─ Dispute with insurer
        └─ Abandon work
```

### Documenting Denial Consequences

**[PHOTO EVIDENCE GUIDE]**

**REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION:**

1. **Current State**
   - Wide shots showing overall condition
   - Close-ups of specific risks
   - Moisture readings
   - Temperature/humidity logs

2. **Predicted Deterioration**
   ```
   "Without approved works, expected outcomes:
   - Day 3: Visible mould growth
   - Day 7: Structural saturation
   - Day 14: Extensive contamination
   - Day 30: Potential condemnation"
   ```

3. **Cost Escalation**
   ```
   Today: $5,000 to complete
   1 week: $10,000 (mould remediation added)
   2 weeks: $20,000 (structural work needed)
   1 month: $40,000 (full reconstruction)
   ```

### Customer Communication Script

**[ROLE-PLAY DIALOGUE]**

**CONTRACTOR:** "Mr. Johnson, I need to discuss the insurance situation. They've approved $10,000 but the full restoration needs $15,000."

**CUSTOMER:** "What does that mean?"

**CONTRACTOR:** "You have several options. We can complete work up to $10,000, which would include [specific items]. The remaining $5,000 of work involves [specific items]."

**CUSTOMER:** "What if I don't do the extra work?"

**CONTRACTOR:** "I'll document the risks, which include [specific risks]. You could pay the $5,000 privately, or we can help you dispute with the insurer."

**CUSTOMER:** "What do you recommend?"

**CONTRACTOR:** "Based on the risks, I recommend either private payment or disputing. Leaving it could cost much more later. Here's everything in writing for your consideration."

# READING MATERIAL: Insurance Contracts Act 1984 - Key Provisions

## SECTION 54: THE CORNERSTONE PROTECTION

### The Full Text

*Section 54(1)*: "Subject to this section, where the effect of a contract of insurance would, but for this section, be that the insurer may refuse to pay a claim, either in whole or in part, by reason of some act of the insured or of some other person, being an act that occurred after the contract was entered into but not being an act in respect of which subsection (2) applies, the insurer may not refuse to pay the claim by reason only of that act but the insurer's liability in respect of the claim is reduced by the amount that fairly represents the extent to which the insurer's interests were prejudiced as a result of that act."

### Breaking It Down

**"Act or omission"**
- Something you did (act)
- Something you didn't do (omission)
- After the policy started
- By you or someone else

**"May not refuse to pay"**
- Absolute prohibition on denial
- For non-causative breaches
- Protects substance over form

**"Reduced by prejudice"**
- Only actual prejudice
- Must be quantified
- Proportionate reduction only

### Judicial Interpretation

**Antico v Heath Fielding Australia (1997)**
- High Court established broad interpretation
- Protection extends to omissions
- Focus on causation not compliance

**FAI v Australian Hospital Care (2001)**
- Prejudice must be real not theoretical
- Insurer bears burden of proof
- Reduction must be proportionate

**Allianz v Waterbrook (2009)**
- Timing of act matters
- Post-loss breaches analyzed differently
- Good faith obligations remain

### Practical Applications

**PROTECTED ACTS/OMISSIONS:**
- Late claim notification (within reason)
- Delayed documentation
- Minor procedure breaches
- Format non-compliance
- Missing signatures
- Wrong forms used
- Communication delays

**UNPROTECTED CONDUCT:**
- Fraud or dishonesty
- Causing the actual loss
- Fundamental dishonesty
- Intentional destruction of evidence
- Criminal acts
- Gross negligence causing damage

## SECTION 13: DUTY OF DISCLOSURE

### The Insured's Obligation

Before entering a contract, the insured must disclose:
- Every matter known to be relevant
- What a reasonable person would know is relevant
- To the insurer's decision to accept risk

### What Must Be Disclosed

**ALWAYS DISCLOSE:**
- Previous claims history
- Prior denials of insurance
- Criminal convictions
- Business financial status
- Compliance breaches
- Licensing status
- Previous bankruptcies

**CONTRACTOR SPECIFIC:**
- IICRC certifications held
- Insurance claim experience
- Types of work performed
- Geographic service area
- Subcontractor usage
- Safety incidents
- Regulatory violations

### Consequences of Non-Disclosure

**Remedies Available to Insurer:**
- Avoid contract entirely
- Reduce claim proportionately
- Vary terms retrospectively
- Deny specific claims

**Fraudulent Non-Disclosure:**
- Contract void from start
- No claims payable
- Premiums not refunded
- Potential prosecution

## SECTION 28: GENERAL AVERAGE

### Understanding Average Clauses

When sum insured is less than value at risk:
- Claim reduced proportionately
- Standard formula applied
- Customer bears shortfall

### The Standard Formula

```
Claim Payment = (Sum Insured / Value at Risk) × Loss Amount
```

### Application to Restoration

# PODCAST EPISODE: "Section 54 Saved My Business" (35 minutes)

## Introduction (0:00-2:00)

**HOST 1 (Mike):** Welcome back to the Restoration Business Podcast. I'm Mike Stevens.

**HOST 2 (Lisa):** And I'm Lisa Park. Mike, today we're talking about something every contractor needs to know but most don't - Section 54 of the Insurance Contracts Act.

**MIKE:** It's literally a business saver, Lisa. I've seen it rescue contractors from bankruptcy multiple times.

## The Real Story (2:00-12:00)

**LISA:** You mentioned you had a contractor with a powerful Section 54 story?

**MIKE:** James from Brisbane. Great operator, meticulous work. Had a major commercial flood job - $400,000 claim. Everything perfect except one thing.

**LISA:** What happened?

**MIKE:** He submitted daily drying logs every three days instead of daily. Just bundled them together. The insurer tried to deny the entire claim for "breach of documentation requirements."

**LISA:** $400,000 denied for late paperwork?

**MIKE:** That was their position. James had already paid subbies, equipment hire, everything. He was facing bankruptcy. Then his lawyer mentioned Section 54.

**LISA:** Walk us through how it worked.

**MIKE:** Section 54 asks one question: Did the late logs cause or contribute to the water damage? Obviously no. The damage happened before he even arrived.

**LISA:** So the insurer had to pay?

**MIKE:** Here's where it gets interesting. They argued they were prejudiced because they couldn't monitor progress daily. The court said that's not material prejudice - the drying either worked or it didn't. The moisture logs showed it worked.

**LISA:** What was the outcome?

**MIKE:** Full payment plus interest for delayed payment. The insurer tried to reduce by $10,000 for "administrative prejudice." Court rejected it entirely.

## Understanding the Protection (12:00-20:00)

**LISA:** So explain Section 54 in plain English.

**MIKE:** Simply put - insurers can't deny claims for technical breaches that didn't cause the loss. It's about fairness. If your paperwork error didn't cause the flood, fire, or mould, they can't use it to avoid paying.

**LISA:** But there must be limits?

**MIKE:** Absolutely. If your breach caused or worsened the damage, Section 54 won't help. Like if you didn't contain Category 3 water and it spread contamination - that's causing additional loss.

**LISA:** What about partial protection?

**MIKE:** Great point. Even if protected by Section 54, insurers can reduce payment for actual prejudice. Say late notification meant they couldn't get their preferred contractor who's cheaper. They might reduce by that difference.

**LISA:** How do you prove prejudice?

**MIKE:** That's the insurer's burden. They must show real, quantifiable prejudice. Not theoretical, not "might have been." Actual dollars and cents or genuine lost opportunities.

## Common Scenarios (20:00-28:00)

**LISA:** Give us examples of when Section 54 protects contractors.

**MIKE:** Sure. Late claim notification - protected unless delay worsened damage. Wrong form used - protected if all information provided. Photos submitted weekly instead of daily - protected if damage documented.

**LISA:** When doesn't it protect?

**MIKE:** Fraud - never protected. Causing the damage through negligence - not protected. Destroying evidence - not protected. Refusing to provide information - not protected.

**LISA:** What about exceeding authorization?

**MIKE:** Tricky one. If you exceed authorization doing necessary work to prevent further damage, Section 54 might help. If you just decided to do extra work, probably not protected.

**LISA:** How should contractors use Section 54?

**MIKE:** Proactively. When insurers raise technical breaches, immediately frame it as a Section 54 issue. Ask: "How did this breach cause or contribute to the loss?" Make them justify any reduction.

## Practical Advice (28:00-33:00)

**LISA:** What should contractors do today to protect themselves?

**MIKE:** First, read Section 54. Print it, laminate it, keep it handy. Second, document everything but don't panic about perfect compliance. Focus on substance - doing good work and preventing further loss.

**LISA:** What about communication with insurers?

**MIKE:** Always professional, always in writing. If they raise a breach, respond with: "We note your concern. However, Section 54 of the Insurance Contracts Act prevents denial for breaches that didn't cause the loss. Please confirm how this breach caused or contributed to the damage."

**LISA:** That's powerful language.

**MIKE:** It shifts the conversation. Instead of defending every minor breach, you're making them prove causation. Most times, they can't.

## Closing Thoughts (33:00-35:00)

**LISA:** Key takeaways for our listeners?

**MIKE:** Section 54 is your shield, not your sword. It protects honest contractors from technical denials but doesn't excuse poor practices. Document well, work professionally, and know your rights.

**LISA:** And if an insurer tries to deny based on technicalities?

**MIKE:** Don't accept it. Cite Section 54. Get legal advice if needed. Remember James - he nearly lost everything until he knew his rights.

**LISA:** Thanks for listening to the Restoration Business Podcast. Next week, we're discussing how to price water damage jobs for profit.

**MIKE:** Until then, stay compliant and know your rights!

# INTERACTIVE QUIZ: Day 2 Assessment

## Question 1
Your daily moisture logs are submitted 5 days late. The insurer wants to deny the claim. Which section protects you?

A) Section 13 - Duty of Disclosure
B) Section 28 - Average Provisions  
C) Section 54 - Acts and Omissions
D) Section 78 - Interest on Claims

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Section 54 protects against claim denial for acts or omissions that didn't cause or contribute to the loss. Late documentation didn't cause the water damage.

## Question 2
Calculate the settlement: Building value $800,000, Sum insured $600,000, Damage $120,000, Co-insurance 80%

A) $120,000
B) $112,500
C) $90,000
D) $93,750

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Required insurance = $800,000 × 0.8 = $640,000. Settlement = ($600,000/$640,000) × $120,000 = $112,500

## Question 3
You're at $7,800 of a $10,000 authorization. What should you do?

A) Complete the job and bill $12,000
B) Stop and seek additional authorization
C) Ask customer to pay difference
D) Continue until exactly $10,000

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** At 78% of authorization, you must stop and seek approval for additional work. Never exceed without written authorization.

## Question 4
True/False: Section 54 protects you if poor drying causes mould growth.

**Answer:** False
**Explanation:** Section 54 only protects when the breach didn't cause or contribute to loss. Poor drying causing mould is a causative breach.

## Question 5
An insurer claims "prejudice" from late notification. What must they prove?

A) You were negligent
B) Actual financial prejudice
C) Policy breach occurred
D) Industry standards weren't met

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Insurers must prove actual, quantifiable prejudice - not theoretical or potential prejudice.

## Question 6
Variation request denied. The work is critical for safety. What's your best option?

A) Abandon the job
B) Complete and rely on Section 54
C) Invoice the customer directly
D) Reduce scope to fit authorization

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Safety-critical work to prevent further damage may be protected under Section 54, as not doing it would worsen the loss.

## Question 7
Which is NOT protected by Section 54?

A) Submitting the wrong form
B) 3-day delay in notification
C) Fraud in claim documentation
D) Missing signature on report

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Fraud is never protected by Section 54. It only protects honest mistakes and technical breaches.

## Question 8
Customer's property is underinsured. Your obligation is to:

A) Refuse the job
B) Disclose and document the shortfall
C) Complete anyway and chase payment
D) Report to insurer only

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** You must disclose underinsurance implications to the customer and document their understanding and decision about the shortfall.

## Question 9
Interest on late claim payment is:

A) Negotiable
B) 5% per annum
C) 10% per annum  
D) Not applicable

**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Section 78 provides for 10% per annum interest on unreasonably delayed claim payments.

## Question 10
Best practice for authorization management is:

A) Exceed by 10% maximum
B) Stop at 75% and reassess
C) Complete then negotiate
D) Verbal approval is sufficient

**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The 75% rule gives you time to seek variations before exceeding authorization, protecting against payment disputes.

# STUDY GUIDE: Day 2 Key Concepts

## The Big Three Protections

### 1. Section 54 - Your Shield
- Protects against technical denials
- Focus on causation not compliance
- Prejudice must be proven and quantified
- Doesn't protect fraud or causative breaches

### 2. Section 13 - Disclosure Duty
- Before policy starts only
- Disclose all material facts
- Consequences can be severe
- Document all disclosures

### 3. Section 78 - Interest Rights
- 10% per annum on late payments
- Automatic entitlement
- From when payment due
- Compounds monthly

## Authorization Management

### The 75% Rule
```
Authorization × 0.75 = Stop Point
$10,000 × 0.75 = $7,500
```

### Variation Elements
1. Current status
2. Additional needs
3. Justification
4. Consequences
5. Evidence
6. Deadline

### Never Do This
- ❌ Exceed without writing
- ❌ Accept verbal approval only
- ❌ Continue without confirmation
- ❌ Hide additional costs
- ❌ Surprise invoice

## Underinsurance Formula
```
Settlement = (Sum Insured ÷ Required Insurance) × Loss
Required Insurance = Replacement Value × 0.8
```

## Key Phrases to Use

### With Insurers
- "Subject to Section 54 protection"
- "Please confirm in writing"
- "How did this breach cause the loss?"
- "What is the quantified prejudice?"
- "Awaiting written authorization"

### With Customers
- "Let me explain your options"
- "Insurance has approved X amount"
- "The shortfall would be Y"
- "I recommend we..."
- "Please confirm your understanding"

## Documentation Essentials
- ✓ Time-stamp everything
- ✓ Photo before/during/after
- ✓ Email confirmations
- ✓ Written variations
- ✓ Customer acknowledgments
- ✓ Denial consequences
- ✓ Safety concerns

## Dispute Resolution Path
1. **Stop** - Don't continue disputed work
2. **Document** - Everything relevant
3. **Communicate** - Professional writing
4. **Escalate** - Through proper channels
5. **Resolve** - Acceptable outcome

## Red Flags
⚠️ "Provisional approval"
⚠️ "Subject to assessment"
⚠️ "Reasonable costs"
⚠️ "Verbal is fine"
⚠️ "Just finish and we'll sort it"

## Golden Rules
1. **Never exceed authorization**
2. **Always get writing**
3. **Document everything**
4. **Disclose shortfalls**
5. **Know your rights**
6. **Stay professional**
7. **Focus on causation**

## Interest Calculation
```
Principal × 0.10 × (Days/365) = Interest
$50,000 × 0.10 × (90/365) = $1,233
```

## Emergency Decision Tree
```
Is it a safety issue?
├─ Yes → Document and proceed
└─ No → Is it preventing further damage?
         ├─ Yes → Document and proceed carefully
         └─ No → Stop and await approval
```
