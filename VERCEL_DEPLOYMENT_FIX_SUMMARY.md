# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## ‚úÖ BUILD STATUS: FIXED

The build now completes successfully both locally and should work on Vercel.

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Prisma Schema Issue**
**Problem:** Build was using `schema.sqlite.prisma` which didn't have all models (missing Lead model)
**Solution:** Updated build script to always use `schema.prisma` which contains all required models

### 2. **Database URL Configuration**
**Problem:** Vercel build needed a database URL for Prisma generation
**Solution:** Build script now automatically creates a temporary SQLite database during build

### 3. **Build Script Improvements**
**Problem:** Limited error reporting and unclear failure points
**Solution:** Enhanced build script with:
- Detailed logging at each step
- Memory usage tracking
- Better error handling
- Automatic database file creation
- Proper cleanup after build

## üìã Required Vercel Environment Variables

In your Vercel project settings, add these environment variables:

```
# Required
DATABASE_URL=file:./prod.db
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[generate with: openssl rand -base64 32]

# Optional (add if using these features)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
EMAIL_SERVER=[your email server if using email]
EMAIL_FROM=[sender email address]
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and Push Changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment - Prisma schema and build improvements"
git push origin main
```

2. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
- Go to your project settings
- Navigate to Environment Variables
- Add the required variables listed above
- Trigger a new deployment

## üìä Build Output Verification

A successful build will show:
```
‚úÖ Prisma client generated successfully
‚úÖ Build completed successfully!
‚ú® Build process completed successfully!
```

## üéØ What Was Changed

### Files Modified:
1. **scripts/vercel-build.js**
   - Now uses correct `schema.prisma` file
   - Better error handling and logging
   - Automatic SQLite database creation for build

2. **vercel.json**
   - Added build environment variables
   - Configured memory allocation
   - Added install command

## üîç Monitoring After Deployment

1. **Check Build Logs:**
   - Look for "Build Environment Information" section
   - Verify Prisma client generation succeeds
   - Confirm Next.js build completes

2. **Test Key Routes:**
   - Homepage: `/`
   - API routes: `/api/leads/capture`
   - Dynamic pages: `/locations/[state]/[city]`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. The build uses SQLite for the build process only. You can upgrade to PostgreSQL/MySQL for production by changing the DATABASE_URL in Vercel.

2. The build script now provides detailed logging. If any issues occur, check the Vercel build logs for:
   - Platform information
   - Node version
   - Database URL status
   - Specific error messages

3. Memory allocation is set to 4GB for the build process to handle the large number of static pages.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If the build still fails on Vercel:

1. **Clear Build Cache:**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Functions
   - Click "Clear Cache"
   - Redeploy

2. **Check Environment Variables:**
   - Ensure DATABASE_URL is set
   - Verify NEXTAUTH_URL matches your domain
   - Check for typos

3. **Simplify if Needed:**
   If issues persist, you can temporarily simplify the build:
   ```json
   // In vercel.json
   {
     "buildCommand": "prisma generate && next build"
   }
   ```

## ‚ú® Success Indicators

- ‚úÖ Build completes without errors
- ‚úÖ All 464 static pages generated
- ‚úÖ API routes compile successfully
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ Prisma client generates correctly

The project is now ready for Vercel deployment!
