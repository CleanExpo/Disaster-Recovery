## ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL PATH ITEMS

**Must Complete First:**
1. Database schema (blocking everything)
2. Base bot framework (blocking bot development)
3. OpenAI integration (blocking NLU)
4. Twilio setup (blocking SMS/Voice)
5. Insurance APIs (blocking claim processing)

**Can Parallelize:**
- Client bot and Contractor bot development
- Frontend and Backend work
- Testing and Documentation
- Analytics and Monitoring

**Dependencies:**
