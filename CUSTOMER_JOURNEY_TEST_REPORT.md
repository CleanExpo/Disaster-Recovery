## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### 1. IMMEDIATE - Fix Route Configuration
```javascript
// Check app/claim/page.tsx exists and exports default
// Check app/demo/workflow/page.tsx exists and exports default
// Verify Next.js routing is configured correctly
```

### 2. URGENT - Component Debugging
```javascript
// Add console.logs to track component mounting
// Check for missing imports or dependencies
// Verify all required props are passed
```

### 3. HIGH - Add Error Boundaries
```javascript
// Implement error boundaries to catch rendering errors
// Add fallback UI for failed components
// Log errors to monitoring service
```

### 4. MEDIUM - Testing Infrastructure
```javascript
// Add unit tests for critical components
// Implement E2E tests for complete journey
// Set up CI/CD pipeline with test gates
```

## Screenshots Captured

1. **01-landing-page** - Shows working homepage
2. **02-claim-form-step1** - Shows broken claim form page

---

## Conclusion

**The platform is currently non-operational for its primary business function.** The customer journey breaks immediately after the landing page, preventing any claims from being submitted or processed. This represents a complete failure of the platform's core functionality.

**Immediate action required:**
1. Fix routing for `/claim` and `/demo/workflow`
2. Ensure components are properly exported and imported
3. Test locally before any production deployment
4. Implement proper error handling and monitoring

**Current State:** ❌ NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

## Test Environment Details

- **Browser:** Chromium (via Playwright)
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080
- **Server:** localhost:3002
- **Framework:** Next.js 14.2.32
- **Test Tool:** Playwright MCP

---

## Next Steps

1. **Fix the routing/rendering issues immediately**
2. **Re-test the complete journey once fixed**
3. **Add comprehensive error handling**
4. **Implement automated testing before deployment**
5. **Set up monitoring for production**

**Estimated Time to Fix:** 2-4 hours for critical issues
