# Fire Science: Understanding Combustion and Smoke Behaviour

## The Physics and Chemistry of Fire Damage

Fire damage restoration requires understanding what happens during combustion and how combustion products affect different materials. This scientific foundation guides every restoration decision.

### Combustion Process and Byproducts

**The Fire Triangle:**
- **Heat**: Sufficient temperature to ignite materials
- **Fuel**: Combustible materials (wood, fabric, plastic, etc.)
- **Oxygen**: Supports combustion process
- **Chain Reaction**: Self-sustaining combustion process

**Stages of Fire Development:**
1. **Incipient Stage**: Initial ignition, limited smoke production
2. **Growth Stage**: Fire spreads, increasing heat and smoke
3. **Fully Developed Stage**: Maximum heat release, intense smoke production
4. **Decay Stage**: Fuel consumption reduces, smoldering continues

**Combustion Products:**
- **Carbon Monoxide**: Toxic gas from incomplete combustion
- **Carbon Dioxide**: Complete combustion product
- **Particulates**: Unburned carbon particles (visible smoke)
- **Organic Compounds**: VOCs from synthetic materials
- **Acids**: Corrosive compounds from certain materials

### Types of Smoke and Damage Patterns

**Protein Smoke:**
- **Source**: Burned food, organic materials at low temperatures
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Thin, greasy film that discolors surfaces
  - Strong odour that penetrates deeply
  - Nearly invisible but causes severe odour problems
  - Thermally activated (heat makes odour stronger)
- **Materials Affected**: All surfaces, especially porous materials
- **Cleaning Challenge**: Requires specialised degreasing agents

**Synthetic Smoke:**
- **Source**: Plastics, synthetic materials, petroleum products
- **Characteristics**:
  - Thick, black, sticky residue
  - Strong chemical odours
  - Heavy particulate contamination
  - Can be corrosive to metals
- **Materials Affected**: All surfaces, penetrates deeply into porous materials
- **Health Concerns**: Contains toxic compounds requiring PPE

**Natural Material Smoke:**
- **Source**: Wood, paper, cotton, natural materials
- **Characteristics**:
  - Dry, powdery residue
  - Easier to clean than synthetic smoke
  - Less penetrating odour
  - Gray to black coloration
- **Materials Affected**: Surfaces closest to fire source primarily
- **Restoration**: Often responds well to conventional cleaning

**Combination Smoke:**
- **Reality**: Most fires produce combination smoke from multiple materials
- **Assessment Challenge**: Requires identifying all contributing materials
- **Restoration Complexity**: May require multiple cleaning approaches
- **Testing**: Often requires testing cleaning methods on small areas

### Smoke Behaviour and Penetration Patterns

**Heat-Driven Smoke Movement:**
- **Convection Currents**: Hot smoke rises, cool smoke sinks
- **Pressure Differentials**: Smoke moves from high to low pressure areas
- **Building Systems**: HVAC systems can distribute smoke throughout structure
- **Thermal Layering**: Hot smoke accumulates at ceiling levels

**Smoke Penetration Factors:**
- **Temperature**: Hot smoke penetrates deeper than cool smoke
- **Pressure**: High pressure forces smoke into small openings
- **Time**: Extended exposure increases penetration depth
- **Material Porosity**: Porous materials absorb more smoke

**Common Penetration Areas:**
- **Wall Cavities**: Behind outlets, switches, and fixtures
- **Ceiling Spaces**: Above dropped ceilings, in attics
- **HVAC Systems**: Ductwork, filters, interior surfaces
- **Contents**: Inside cabinets, drawers, closets
- **Electronics**: Internal components of TVs, computers, appliances

### Damage Assessment Methodology
