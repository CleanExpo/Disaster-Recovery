# "WHO'S FIRST?" - The Ultimate Positioning Strategy for Disaster Recovery

## Executive Summary
**The Question Everyone Asks:** "Who do I call first?"
**The Answer:** "Disaster Recovery - Always First, Always Right"

## Core Concept
When disaster strikes, confusion reigns. People don't know:
- Who to call first (Insurance? Plumber? Restoration company?)
- What order to do things in
- How to protect their claim
- What their rights are
- How to prevent further damage

**We position ourselves as THE FIRST CALL because we understand the ENTIRE PROCESS.**

## The Psychology Behind "Who's First?"

### Why People Ask This Question
1. **Panic Mode**: Disasters trigger fight-or-flight responses
2. **Information Overload**: Too many options, no clear path
3. **Fear of Mistakes**: Wrong first call = denied claims, higher costs
4. **Time Pressure**: Every minute counts in damage mitigation
5. **Trust Deficit**: Don't know who to trust in vulnerable moments

### Our Response Framework
"When you don't know who to call first, you call Disaster Recovery. We orchestrate everything else."
