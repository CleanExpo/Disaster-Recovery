# Product Goals & Strategic Roadmap
## Disaster Recovery Professional Network

---

## Executive Summary

We are building the **"Uber for Disaster Recovery"** - a two-sided marketplace that connects property owners directly with IICRC-certified restoration professionals, disrupting the current broken system where Third-Party Administrators (TPAs) control the industry without accountability or expertise.

### The Problem We're Solving
- **$2.5 billion** Australian restoration industry controlled by office-based TPAs
- **70% dissatisfaction rate** with current restoration services
- **42-day average** claim resolution vs 14-day standard
- **Zero accountability** from TPAs for restoration quality
- **3-day training** for builder employees vs 200+ hours for professionals

### Our Solution
Direct connection platform between property owners and certified professionals with:
- Legal duty of care obligations
- Transparent pricing and qualifications
- 24-hour emergency response guarantee
- Professional accountability and insurance
- Quality-based competition, not cost-cutting
